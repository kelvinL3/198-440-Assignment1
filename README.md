This Project is a practice in machine learning
Ideas used: hill climb, random walk, random restart, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms
Create a puzzle that is very hard to solve
Puzzles are a matrix where you start at the top left and "jump" your way to the bottom right
The number you're standing on is the distance away you can jump.

Download all the files into a directory
Edit driver.py and uncomment the code that you want to run
Run driver.py, GUI windows will open, closing them will allow the program to finish
GUI windows shows the puzzles generated before and after the algorithm
Score is the number of steps to get to the bottom right starting from the top left, or if that is impossible, -1 * the number of cells uncreachable
